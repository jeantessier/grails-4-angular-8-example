# Grails 4 Angular 8 Profile CRUD Web Application Example

Taken from
https://www.djamware.com/post/5a10b5f580aca75eadc12d6c/grails-3-angular-5-profile-crud-web-application-example

When I use Grails 4.0.3, it claims to create an Angular 6
app, but it is really an Angular 8.2.14 app.

I tried to update the Angular app to Angular 9 by following
the instructions at https://update.angular.io/#8.2:9.0 but
the resulting app won't start.  It complains about the Node
version.  My system's Node should be good enough, so I don't
know where it's taking its Node from, if it is not the one
on the system.
